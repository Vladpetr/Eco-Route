# Eco-Route
Optimizes waste removal operations, utilizing heuristic algorithms to develop an efficient waste collection schedule to conserve fuel.

## Project Overview
This project provides an extensive overview of waste collection approaches in San Francisco County. It utilizes a simulation model based on the Travelling Salesman Problem to explore different waste collection strategies and their impact on key metrics related to the process. Efficient waste collection is a complex problem, and this project aims to narrow down the scope by applying two waste collection strategies: random and greedy. The simulation observes how varying the number of farms, the maximum waste on a farm, and the number of drop-off sites affects metrics such as working time, drop-off site visits, driving time, and fuel consumption.
